# About Me
Hi! I'm Ben, a 17yo musician and developer who writes for fun and practice. I'm the most experienced with Python and Rust, but I've enjoyed working on projects in other languages as well - my favorite so far is Haskell. I started here with JavaScript when I was 13 or 14, but I've barely used it in the past few years since I'm not quite as interested in web development anymore.
